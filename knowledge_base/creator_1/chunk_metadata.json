This could be screenshots, screen recordings, B-roll, images, PNGs, charts slash graphs, et cetera. Add these all throughout your video. Number two, formats. Sitting down and talking form videos are boring, but you can film with an engaging format to make them perform better. Number three, your script. Always write out your script, never freestyle. I have mine right here. Here's some script structures for storytelling videos and educational videos that you can use. Number four, your captions. Your face should be here. Your written hook should be up here. Your captions are gonna be right here. And your visuals are typically gonna go right here. And then number five, just some little extra engaging elements, like adding in sound effects. Here are some of my favorites. Huh? Adding in music. Here are some of my most used ones.

Using your research, select a proven viral, verbal, and written hook. Number two, value. Using your own knowledge and experience, decide what you want to teach in the video. Number three, the CTA. Using this chart, choose a CTA template to use. And number four, the format. Using the options on the screen, select what engaging way you plan to film the video.

After three months, person A, you've gotten multiple viral videos, seven million profile views, but only a couple hundred followers and a few leads. And person B, after three months, you've gotten some semi-viral videos, one million profile views, 10,000 plus followers, and thousands of leads. Bish, what? Trends, trending audio plus B-roll videos, and aesthetic videos get views. Educational, storytelling, and talking form videos get followers and leads.

I research current popular trends on social media, recreate these trends adjusted to my business, and post one video every single day. And person B, what about you? I'm gonna research and use viral outlier hooks and topics from small to mid-sized creators, script out the value of each video with my own knowledge and experiences, and post five times a week. After three months, person A, you've gotten multiple viral videos, seven million profile views, but only a couple hundred followers and a few leads. And person B, after three months, you've gotten some semi-viral videos, one million profile views, 10,000 plus followers, and thousands of leads. Bish, what? Trends, trending audio plus B-roll videos, and aesthetic videos get views. Educational, storytelling, and talking form videos get followers and leads. Want thousands of examples of good educational storytelling short-form content that you can use as inspiration? Just comment 1,000 and I will send it over.",

I didn't make this video to go viral. I really just hope it provides value to the right people. Number one, religiously doubling down. Doubling down is when you recreate your best performing videos, but just with one small change every single time. So here are a few videos that worked really well for me and that I doubled down on. Number two, measurable value. So this right here, that is fluffy value. And this is measurable value. It's clear and ultra specific, and I made sure to just use measurable value. And number three, I scripted the value of my video first, then I found a viral hook to add on. So instead of finding a viral hook and then scripting the value and just being kind of like uncreative, I scripted my knowledge, my experience, all my lessons that I truly know about social media first, and then I found a viral hook to add on because I will always use a proven viral hook. But that way it wasn't like tunnel visioned when I was writing. I actually just wrote what I wanted to talk about and then found a hook to match that. This is why I'm saying I didn't make the video for virality because this is not gonna make sense to a lot of people. Anyway, that is it. That",

I didn't make this video to go viral. I really just hope it provides value to the right people. Number one, religiously doubling down. Doubling down is when you recreate your best performing videos, but just with one small change every single time. So here are a few videos that worked really well for me and that I doubled down on. Number two, measurable value. So this right here, that is fluffy value. And this is measurable value. It's clear and ultra specific, and I made sure to just use measurable value. And number three, I scripted the value of my video first, then I found a viral hook to add on. So instead of finding a viral hook and then scripting the value and just being kind of like uncreative, I scripted my knowledge, my experience, all my lessons that I truly know about social media first, and then I found a viral hook to add on because I will always use a proven viral hook. But that way it wasn't like tunnel visioned when I was writing. I actually just wrote what I wanted to talk about and then found a hook to match that. This is why I'm saying I didn't make the video for virality because this is not gonna make sense to a lot of people. Anyway, that is it. That is how I gained 50,000 followers within the last month.

Step number three, posting mount and schedule. Choose either easy, moderate, or hard. This is purely just to hold you accountable. Step number four, research. Go to the Instagram Explore page, search your niche, click the Reels tab, and save one million plus view videos that you like. Repeat this with all of your sub-niches. Step number five, study. Add all of those links to a spreadsheet and write out the video's written, verbal, and visual hook, as well as their topic. Step number six, script. Batch script a month of content using the viral-proven hooks and topics, but use your own knowledge and experience to write out the value of each video. Then add a follow CTA to the end. Step number seven, film. Don't film boring sitting down and talking videos. Film each video with an engaging format. Step number eight, edit. You can do this yourself, or you can have someone edit your videos for you so they look all pretty. Step number nine, post. Use your predetermined posting schedule and post your new videos.

Determine your overall niche, and then five to 10 sub-niches that all relate to your broad niche. Step number two, create account. Here is a guide you can screenshot on how to optimize your profile. Step number three, posting mount and schedule. Choose either easy, moderate, or hard. This is purely just to hold you accountable. Step number four, research. Go to the Instagram Explore page, search your niche, click the Reels tab, and save one million plus view videos that you like. Repeat this with all of your sub-niches. Step number five, study. Add all of those links to a spreadsheet and write out the video's written, verbal, and visual hook, as well as their topic. Step number six, script. Batch script a month of content using the viral-proven hooks and topics, but use your own knowledge and experience to write out the value of each video. Then add a follow CTA to the end. Step number seven, film. Don't film boring sitting down and talking videos. Film each video with an engaging format. Step number eight, edit. You can do this yourself, or you can have someone edit your videos for you so they look all pretty. Step number nine, post. Use your predetermined posting schedule and post your new videos. Step number 10, repeat. Do this process over and over again every single month, and you'll grow on social media like my clients and I. Or if you want us to just do all of this for you, all you have to do is film. Comment SMM for more information.",

All of them gain hundreds of thousands of followers through this. So here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to create your own. Step number one, niche. Pick an overall niche slash topic for your series. Step number two, pick a series type. Here are some of the most common ones I'm seeing work very well right now. Some examples of these would be Chloe's iconic 30 lessons by 30 series, or this guy's building luxury cabin series at age 22. Those are just a few great examples. Step number three, create a rough draft of your series. Plan the number of episodes and the outline of each episode, as well as the posting schedule to hold yourself accountable. Step number four, create. Script, film, edit, and post one video at a time and repeat. And there you have it. If you want a PDF breaking this down, just comment series and I'll go ahead and send it over.",

All of them gain hundreds of thousands of followers through this. So here's a step-by-step tutorial on how to create your own. Step number one, niche. Pick an overall niche slash topic for your series. Step number two, pick a series type. Here are some of the most common ones I'm seeing work very well right now. Some examples of these would be Chloe's iconic 30 lessons by 30 series, or this guy's building luxury cabin series at age 22. Those are just a few great examples. Step number three, create a rough draft of your series. Plan the number of episodes and the outline of each episode, as well as the posting schedule to hold yourself accountable. Step number four, create. Script, film, edit, and post one video at a time and repeat. And there you have it. If you want a PDF breaking this down, just comment series and I'll go ahead and send it over.",

Yeah, well, this strategy is called templatizing your viral outliers. Step number one, get a viral outlier, AKA a video that has 5X views and your account's following. Step number two, templatize the viral video. Make the scripts and shots into a repeatable template, just like Jessa did with her outlier reel. So all she has to do is switch out the flavors. Step number three, double down. Script, edit, film, and post your templatized viral videos. And if you just do that over and over again, you will grow. And I can say that so confidently because I tried this for myself over the past three months. Here are my stats over the past 90 days. I have got over 12 million views and 83,000 more followers.

Step number two, templatize the viral video. Make the scripts and shots into a repeatable template, just like Jessa did with her outlier reel. So all she has to do is switch out the flavors. Step number three, double down. Script, edit, film, and post your templatized viral videos. And if you just do that over and over again, you will grow. And I can say that so confidently because I tried this for myself over the past three months. Here are my stats over the past 90 days. I have got over 12 million views and 83,000 more followers. If I preach it, you best believe I'm gonna practice it myself. And if you want more social media marketing education that actually works, follow for more.",

Each creator has one or more iconic series. Wait, I've literally seen some of theirs before. Series generate a lot of followers because people wanna see the next episode. If you wanna create your own, just follow these four steps. Got it, then what? Step number two, storytelling. Each episode of these creator series almost always use storytelling to teach a valuable lesson. Here are some of my favorite storytelling frameworks. You said three steps. Step number three, multiple formats. There are multiple different formats you can use to film a video. Their videos almost always follow a mix of these three formats. Number one, shot slash angle change format. Every two seconds of the video, a new shot slash angle is used. Number two, a visual format. Using a prop to demonstrate a niche concept. Number three, a voiceover format. What I'm doing right now in this moment. All of those keep the viewer psychologically hooked. Yep, and I know it seems like these creators grow overnight",

Each episode of these creator series almost always use storytelling to teach a valuable lesson. Here are some of my favorite storytelling frameworks. You said three steps. Step number three, multiple formats. There are multiple different formats you can use to film a video. Their videos almost always follow a mix of these three formats. Number one, shot slash angle change format. Every two seconds of the video, a new shot slash angle is used. Number two, a visual format. Using a prop to demonstrate a niche concept. Number three, a voiceover format. What I'm doing right now in this moment. All of those keep the viewer psychologically hooked. Yep, and I know it seems like these creators grow overnight, but a lot of them have been posting for years. Now we're finally getting the incredible momentum we deserve. So just don't get discouraged when it's taking a while because that's just how it goes. Wow, where did you even learn this? Oh, I follow Ava. She talks about social media marketing education.",

You may know me as the 19-year-old who built a $7 million company, or the psychopath who gets up at 2 a.m. every day, or the girl who got engaged at 16 and married at 19. But regardless, I wanted to reintroduce myself. I grew up right outside of Milwaukee in Wisconsin. As a child, I was an abomination. No! Some even may say deranged, ADHD-filled, and stubborn as hell. There was nothing special about me, but I always knew I wanted to do something great. I'm a cat. At 14 years old, I started dating this muscular hottie named Ben. About a year into our relationship, we read a book called Rich Dad Poor Dad, which led us to starting a real estate investing company at age 15. And by the time I graduated high school at 17, we acquired one million in rental properties. Right after I graduated, I noticed all these business owners building big personal brands on social media. So I decided to start posting short-form content to do the same. In the first month, I got 50,000 followers and fell in love with social media marketing. The truth is, I absolutely hated real estate. It was utterly miserable. So I stopped doing that and started a company called Personal Brand Launch, where I help business owners grow and sell on social media. Two years later, we are now a multimillion dollar",

    "chunk_text": "Hi, my name's Ava. You may know me as the 19-year-old who built a $7 million company, or the psychopath who gets up at 2 a.m. every day, or the girl who got engaged at 16 and married at 19. But regardless, I wanted to reintroduce myself. I grew up right outside of Milwaukee in Wisconsin. As a child, I was an abomination. No! Some even may say deranged, ADHD-filled, and stubborn as hell. There was nothing special about me, but I always knew I wanted to do something great. I'm a cat. At 14 years old, I started dating this muscular hottie named Ben. About a year into our relationship, we read a book called Rich Dad Poor Dad, which led us to starting a real estate investing company at age 15. And by the time I graduated high school at 17, we acquired one million in rental properties. Right after I graduated, I noticed all these business owners building big personal brands on social media. So I decided to start posting short-form content to do the same. In the first month, I got 50,000 followers and fell in love with social media marketing. The truth is, I absolutely hated real estate. It was utterly miserable. So I stopped doing that and started a company called Personal Brand Launch, where I help business owners grow and sell on social media. Two years later, we are now a multimillion dollar company with over 100 team members and hundreds of amazing clients. Also, I got married to my best friend, Ben, who owns his own successful company. We live together in a mediocre ranch with our dog named Bear and two cats we love. I get chills knowing that this is just the beginning. I can't wait to see what we do and who we become.

We're gonna study the video hooks, the video topics, layouts, et cetera, so we know exactly what goes viral in your industry. Step three, one of our professional copywriters who have scripted loads of viral content will create a month worth of scripts based off the research and everything we learned about you and your biz on the onboarding call. Step four, then all you gotta do is film. Step number five, we'll take the content you filmed back and have our professional editors edit the videos. Step number six, we will manually post the videos for you onto social media because scheduling actually hurts your results. Then you'll start to see results that I get and my clients get.
